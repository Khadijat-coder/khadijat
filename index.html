        <img src="founder of whatsapp.jpeg" alt="">
        <p class="park">WhatsApp was founded in February 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!. A month earlier, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone's Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.[62]

            Their discussions often took place at the home of Koum's Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose.          <a href="Vhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp">Read More</a>

His initial creation was Burbn, so named because of his interest in whiskey and bourbon. Inspired by the popularity of Foursquare and other location-based platforms, Burbn allowed users to post check-ins along with photos, which were not yet a staple of social posting.         <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Instagram">Read More</a>
